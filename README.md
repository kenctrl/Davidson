<b>Abstract:</b>\
Many quantum algorithms that attempt to reconstruct ground state wave functions have low fidelity and are not robust against noise. We introduce the projected cooling sensor algorithm, which accurately reconstructs the ground state of any general Hamiltonian, to solve the quantum ground state preparation problem. For low-dimension Hamiltonians, the projected cooling sensor algorithm reconstructs the ground state with a relative error of $0.0001$ or less. For high-dimension Hamiltonians, multiple iterations of the projected cooling sensor algorithm exponentially decrease the error of the reconstructed ground state. We find that on a quantum computer, the reconstructed ground state has nearly $100\%$ overlap with the exact ground state. The projected cooling sensor algorithm can be applied to a wide range of general many-body systems, including nuclei, bulk materials, superconductors, and Ising models. When simulated on a quantum computer, the projected cooling sensor algorithm has the potential to achieve quantum supremacy over classical computations for any quantum Hamiltonian.
